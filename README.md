# Zeus Botnet Memory Analysis

We will analyze memory dump with Volatility.
We run the following command to find out from which system the image was taken.


<code>vol.exe -f zeus.vmem imageinfo </code>

Processes taken in the image are displayed with the following command.

<code>vol.exe -f zeus.vmem pstree</code>

There doesn't appear to be a problem with running processes.
We will check if there is a connection to the machine and if there is a connection to the machine, we will find out which process started via PiD.

<code>vol.exe -f zeus.vmem connscan</code>

When we look at the screenshot above, we see that svchost.exe connects to the connection on port 80.This is not normal for svchost.exe.
(For more information on svchost.exe, see here. https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/what-is-svchostexe-and-why-is-it-running/ )

We continue

We check whether the address 193.104.41.75 is in the black list via ipvoid.com.

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32979760/111482693-3369d880-8745-11eb-8d0f-5e9eab88b57b.PNG)

We see that the result is clean.


We check the ip address on the malwaredomain.com site.

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32979760/111530822-d2f28f80-8774-11eb-8c6a-bc025803b9da.PNG)

It has been observed that the ip address is distributing malicious files and the description is zeus botnet.

Let's see if the malicious file runs itself at startup.

<code>vol.exe -f zeus.vmem printkey -K "Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"</code>
